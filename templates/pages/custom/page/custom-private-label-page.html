                    Private labeling is a procedure used to manufacture bath and body products by a third party and sell them under your brand. You just need to worry about a few items during this procedure, like labeling design and your target market. We take care of the rest. We are a full turnkey solution, and we will provide product development, formulating, packaging procurement, and label printing, for a fully completed retail experience.

                    We wanted to create a dedicated section for this as it is usually a common initial question. We have the lowest MOQ in the industry for a fully automated facility that manufactures to our standard. For products in a jar or a bottle, the MOQ is 500 units per variation. If we are creating custom pouches for you, which we can do in-house, the MOQ is 1000 units per variation. It is important to us to try and lower the barriers to entry to this market and our MOQ certainly helps us live up to that initiative.

In this meeting we will review your project, your brand, your time-line and your goals. Our focus is to ensure we understand your vision of what you are hoping to achieve for your customers and your business.

                                    <strong>Scenting Options</strong> - While many of our products have a wonderfully natural scent from the organic and natural ingredients used, we understand the importance of offering different and beautiful scents for bath, body and some skin care products. We manufacture all our fragrances in house and have an array of 3500 fragrances to choose from. We offer fragrance oils and essential oils as well. We are sure to have something that tickles your fancy and all our fragrance oils are phthalate free fragrances.

                                    <strong>Labeling Options</strong> - When it comes to labeling your product we only use the best, no matter the quantity. We use full color offset printing using water proof labels with lamination for every label. This is usually the first thing that your customers will see so we make sure you put your best foot forward. We do offer screen printing services as well. Your project specialists will work with you to provide you with the best option to meet your needs.

The only thing in the process that we may outsource is packaging. Being that every customer we work with has a different vision, we source our jars, bottles and tops from the largest distributor in the United States. We source a wide range of quality recyclable PET, glass and aluminum packaging choices for our clients. We also manufacture “in-house” custom printed flexible packaging, as well as custom printed tubes. We will present you with the best options available to meet your budget and branding goals.

                        Starting from scratch to develop your skincare or cosmetics lines can be difficult, time-consuming, and extremely costly.

You can significantly reduce your effort by partnering with a seasoned private label manufacturer who specializes in skincare formulation, product design, packaging, packing, and delivery. We will assist you in ensuring that goods are produced consistently for your brand.

Being that our MOQ is already an industry minimum, you had better believe that the initial cost outlay is an industry-breaking low as well. Our full private labeling service projects start at roughly $2500 and can go up from there depending on the product you are  trying to make. So, for example, a 16oz bath salt with a full custom formula at 500 units with your custom label would start at about $2500.

                                    On the other end of the spectrum, a Dead Sea mud mask would cost roughly $3500 for a full complete product. The price varies widely depending on what you need us to make. Please note that we manufacture a product based on your needs and we are not selling you a premade product. We can go as mild or as wild as you need us to.

                    A new program that has become very popular is our private label-ready program. So, what if you are not ready to order 500 units of a single SKU because you are just starting, or your budget just doesn’t allow it? No worries at all. Everyone must start somewhere, and we have a new program just for you. It is an entry point to private labeling that will reduce the MOQ to six units but will require you to label the product.
                </p>

                <p class="custom-text text-center-mb text-white">
                    Our “PRIVATE LABEL-READY” program is built just for you. Our Private Label-Ready program has minimums as low as 6 units per SKU and this is where we take our retail products (only products in bottles or jars) and send them to you unlabeled so you can design and apply your label and start building your brand. Once you are ready for us to take over the 500-unit quantity, we can handle everything at that point. The product would use our retail formula and packaging, so you know you are getting a tried and tested formula that we currently sell to our retail clients. The difference between this program and the full Private Label program is that you cannot select the packaging or customize the formula. The product will come unlabeled and ready for you to label. We will insert a completed label into your packaging so you can see the label size we used and the details that we put on our label. In general, the MOQ is 6 units, and the cost is 50% of the retail cost listed on our website. (Shipping is an additional cost depending on where you are located.) This is a great way to get started and test the market. Email us for more specifics based on your needs. We are always striving to lower the barrier to entry into this market and with our Private Label ready program getting started is a breeze.

So, you can have the entire ingredient deck or just an idea of the product with no ingredient details and we will assist with the formula.

                            Yes, you can order samples. As a company, we do not have formulation fees. So, if we think we can make a product we do not charge you for formulating the product to assess our ability to make it for you. We do charge a sampling fee once we have assessed that we can make the product and are ready to send it to you. Our sampling fee starts at $25 and will depend on the product and quantity needed. Inquire about samples to see the cost of your specific needs. The sampling fee does include shipping as well.

                            Packaging is the only part of the private label process that we do not manufacture in-house. Because we want your product to be based on your vision, we don’t limit products to being put in “stock” packaging. We source all the packaging for each product. If we can find it available in the market, we can fill it. We also can use the packaging that you send to us as well. So, there are no limits on the packaging.
