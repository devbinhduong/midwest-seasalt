<!-- WHAT IS BULK & WHOLESALE -->

                    We first want to start with the definition of bulk and wholesale as often this is confused with private labeling. Our Bulk and Wholesale program consists of formulas that are sold in large quantities. So, if you are looking for a custom formula or a stock formula but don’t need retail packaging then this would fall under our bulk & wholesale program. This program is popular with hospitality end users, spa owners, as well as companies that want to do their packaging. If you would like to complete the final retail product and just need great formulas, then you have found the last company you will ever need.

                    This is usually the first question that gets asked regarding ordering in bulk and wholesale. You can order products from us in any quantity, but our discounted pricing starts at 250 pounds per SKU (variation). Just like with our private label program, our bulk program allows you to have fully customized blends tailored to your needs. We make every product to order, so you have full control over any specific formulation requirements. Request our pricelist above and get a detailed brochure and our pricelist.

                            Our bulk/wholesale program is made for clients that need raw ingredients and formulations in bulk with no retail packaging. We work with many private labelers, spas, hotels and bulk end users that need products to use specially on there clients or in production efforts that they have. This program provides the same great custom formulations that our private label division gets but without the retail packaging.

                            There is no minimum to buy in bulk but our wholesale pricing starts at 250 pounds or 25 gallons. So, technically you could order less than 250 pounds, but the pricing will not have the bulk division discount applied. In many cases, you will be able to purchase smaller quantities directly from our website depending on what you need.

                            We make this process super simple. Give us as many details as you have about the ingredients you would like in your product. We will take this info and fill in any missing ingredients or details to come up with your ingredient deck. So, you can have the entire ingredient deck or just an idea of the product with no ingredient details and we will assist with the formula.

So, if we think we can make a product we do not charge you for formulating the product to assess our ability to make it for you. We do charge a sampling fee once we have assessed that we can make the product and are ready to send it to you. Our sampling fee starts at $25 and will depend on the product and quantity needed. Inquire about samples to see the cost of your specific needs. The sampling fee does include shipping as well.

                            This is a valid question and one of the reasons that we are so successful. Your identity is of utmost importance. With every order, we will sign and send you a Non-Disclosure Agreement asserting that we will never divulge any client info. No products will ship with our names on them, and our physical production floor is off-limits and non-personal. So, no tours, visits, or walkthroughs are allowed. Our shipments are isolated so even freight companies do not have access to our production floor which houses the most important asset you own… Your Brand Identity. We have you COVERED… literally.
